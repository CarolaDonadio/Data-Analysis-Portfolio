Project: Merx Key Metrics Dashboard

This project aims to develop an interactive dashboard that consolidates and visualizes key metrics related to sales and product performance in Merx, providing users with a high-level analysis tool for strategic decision making. The dashboard presents a variety of metrics and graphs that allow observing sales behavior, profit margins, and performance by categories, subcategories, and labels, as well as annual and monthly comparisons.

Areas of Analysis:
• Total Sales: The dashboard includes a Total Sales indicator, which reflects the overall sales volume generated during a specific period. This metric is key to measuring the overall performance of the platform or company and serves as a basis for other analyses.

• Total Utility: This indicator displays the Total Utility generated, showing the profits obtained after costs. This is essential data for evaluating the profitability of the business and is complemented by other metrics such as the profit margin.

• Total Margin: Total Margin refers to the percentage of profit the company earns on total sales. This metric is essential to understanding the efficiency of the company in terms of its profit margins, which helps evaluate pricing policies, operating costs, and business strategies.

• Sales by Category: A detailed view of Sales by Category is offered, where products are grouped into large categories (e.g., technology, fashion, home, etc.). This metric allows users to see how each category is performing overall, helping to identify the most profitable areas and those that require more attention.

• Totals by Subcategories and Product Tags: Through segmentation by Subcategories and Product Tags, the dashboard shows the breakdown of sales within categories. Subcategories can reflect smaller specializations (e.g., “smartphones” within “technology”) and product tags (e.g., “new,” “special offer”) offer additional information on the type of products that are selling best.

• Category Sales: A deeper view of Category Sales is presented, showing how sales are distributed across different categories and subcategories, allowing for more granular analysis. Users can identify which categories are driving business and which need adjustments in terms of marketing, inventory, or pricing.

• Annual Comparison: Sales by Purchase Type: This section compares Sales by Purchase Type (e.g., online vs. in-store purchases) over a yearly period, providing insight into customer preferences and the most successful sales channels. This analysis is essential for understanding consumer behavior trends and for adjusting omnichannel sales strategies.

• Historical Metrics by Month and Year: The Historical Metrics section allows you to see the evolution of sales, profit, and other key indicators over months and years. This section makes it easy to identify long-term trends, such as seasonal growth or declines in certain periods, which is useful for planning marketing strategies and improving sales forecasting.

• Metric Details for Product Hierarchies: The dashboard also presents a breakdown of metrics for each Product Hierarchy. The hierarchies reflect the structure of products in terms of their relationship (e.g. category > subcategory > product). This breakdown allows users to drill down into the performance of specific products, helping to identify which are the most profitable within their hierarchy and facilitating decision making at the product level.

Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive visual tool that allows decision makers to effectively monitor sales performance, margins and other key indicators. The dashboard facilitates real-time data analysis, allowing to identify areas for improvement, optimize sales strategy and maximize business profitability.

Expected Impact:
With this dashboard, it is expected to:

• Improve decision making by providing key information in a clear and accessible way.
• Optimize inventory management and resource allocation, by identifying the best performing categories and products.
• Promote strategic marketing and sales planning, by having a historical and comparative vision that facilitates the identification of growth and adjustment opportunities.

Tools Used:
Data visualization tools such as Power BI and Excel have been used to develop this dashboard. These tools allow the integration of large volumes of data and the creation of interactive visualizations that facilitate the interpretation of key metrics. In addition, statistical techniques are used to perform predictive analysis and obtain valuable insights into future performance.
